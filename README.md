## Customizing for Your Language

KAnki makes it easy to study any language by changing just a few files:

### 1. Prepare the font for your target language

Download or convert a TTF font file that supports your target language. Rename it to `language.ttf` and place it in:
```
kanki/assets/fonts/language.ttf
```

### 2. Update the configuration file

Edit `kanki/js/kanki_config.js` to include your language configuration and vocabulary:

```javascript
/**
 * KAnki Configuration
 * Edit these settings to customize the app for your language
 */
var KANKI_CONFIG = {
  language: "Spanish",  // Change this to your language name
  levels: ["A1", "A2", "B1"]   // These should match the keys in your VOCABULARY object
};

/**
 * Vocabulary Data
 * Organized by proficiency level
 */
var VOCABULARY = {
  "A1": [
    {"front": "hello", "back": "hola", "notes": "Greeting"},
    // Add more words...
  ],
  "A2": [
    {"front": "tomorrow", "back": "ma√±ana", "notes": "Time"},
    // Add more words...
  ],
  // Add more levels...
};
```

For languages with different writing systems, use the `reading` property:

```javascript
{"front": "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ", "reading": "konnichiwa", "back": "Hello", "notes": "Greeting"}
```

### Technical Details
